Galen IDE
====================

For now this is consider to be a prototype but I hope to finish it and release it as a proper standalone application.
The code is quite messy (especially the frontend part) and it doesn't even have any unit tests :). But it already works and can be used for quick responsive and cross-browser layout testing.
